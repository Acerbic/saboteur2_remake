# Saboteur2 website remake #

"Saboteur 2" was an old game for ZX Spectrum machine released in 1987. Long after the game's time, a fan (sabotwo@gmail.com) made a website dedicated to it - http://www.saboteur2.ru

This project is a remake of the website, updating its presentation and layout (but not contents) to modern web standards. It is partly an excersize of my skills as webdev, and partly me paying respects to the game I played so much as a child.
